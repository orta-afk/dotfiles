> yeah what more can i say about it... uhh

Yeah **_I use Arch btw_**, and **helix** — old **neoVim** user *"btw"* but I like how helix works so yeah 🤧🤧🤧  
Also I use **alacritty**, and whoever's getting pissed about that or wanna say "kitty is better" or "why not ghostty blah blah" 👉 **idgaf ty**

## ✨ Some Mentions

- I use `wal` for generating color palettes and themes from my wallpaper — super helpful.  
- I use `tmux` as my multiplexer / session manager / productivity coping mechanism.  
- I use `i3` with `x11` as my display manager.  
- I use `ly` because the doom animation is 🔥.  
- Package list is also available, although good chance it's outdated 💀.

## 🤷‍♂️ How to Use It

1. Clone the repo  
2. Yeet it into your `.config/` folder  
3. Restart stuff if needed  
4. Pray it works

> ⚠️ **Note**: Not every file goes into `.config`, but most of them do.
